This project is a Mac OS-inspired user interface clone built using React. It aims to replicate the look and feel of the Mac OS desktop environment, including features like a dock, windows, and draggable elements.

### Features

- **Windows**: Resizable and draggable windows to mimic the Mac OS experience.
- **Desktop**: A clean and responsive desktop layout.
- **Theming**: Light and dark mode support for a modern aesthetic.

### Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the component-based UI.
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling and maintaining scoped styles.
- **React Draggable**: To enable drag-and-drop functionality for windows.
- **React Icons**: For adding Mac OS-like icons.

This project demonstrates the power of React in creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces while paying attention to design details inspired by Mac OS.
