An artist, Alicia, convicted of killing her husband, is admitted to a psychiatric center by order of the court, as she refuses to speak at all.

The incident left her in such deep shock that, even after several years, no medical professional has been able to make any progress in the case.

Then comes Theo, our protagonist, who takes on the challenge of making Alicia talk.

This story strongly emphasizes the importance of proper childhood upbringing. It revolves around how childhood traumas can affect a person in adulthood, damaging their self-image so deeply that they struggle to put the pieces together, even later in life. They may fail to perform basic chores, lack confidence due to the absence of a mother's love or the fear caused by a father's trauma, and attempt to fill their emptiness with quick fixes that bring harmful consequences, often falling into addiction or going astray.

All just to escape the haunting flashbacks of their childhood trauma.

Both Dr. Theo and Alicia carry heavy baggage from the painful pasts of their families.

The story also explores the consequences of love, marriage, jealousy, and career-driven affairs. In fact, Theo and Alicia are drawn together by similar experiences with infidelity. It all feels like a circle, the story flows in such a way that it brings you back exactly where you started.

As a reader, you'll experience a mix of suspense, anger, empathy, and even laughter. Written through Theo's perspective, the narration makes you live the character, especially when he describes his feelings about drugs, love, hatred, anger, detachment, and jealousy. You'll find yourself on an emotional rollercoaster, mostly blue, and obviouslyâ€¦ silence.
