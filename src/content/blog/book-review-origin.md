When I started reading it, I felt this book could almost be "banned" because it begins in a way that seems against religion, trying to erase it from the world or create a new one. The story looks for answers to two big questions of human life: "Where did we come from?" and "Where are we going?" through the ideas of scientist Edmond Kirsch and professor Robert Langdon. Naturally, religious groups like churches and monks stand against these ideas.

What follows is an exciting clash of religion, science, philosophy, facts, and technology. In the end, it reveals who is really controlling the events in the story. Surprisingly, the book even predicts the rise of AI, LLMs, AGI, and similar technology before they became common topics.

It also suggests the idea of "Technium," a new form of life that combines humans and technology, which could grow faster than us and possibly replace humanity by 2050.

If you enjoy dramatic twists, sometimes a little childish, and nonstop suspense, this book is for you. I would rate it 7.5 out of 10.

The novel is easy to follow, but sometimes it feels slow because of Langdon's usual over-explanations and a few weak plot twists.

Overall, Origin is a great read for Dan Brown fans. It is full of real details about places, people, and history. Along the way, you will learn interesting things about art, science, religion, and technology.

It could make a really good thriller movie, as it definitely has more action than The Da Vinci Code.
