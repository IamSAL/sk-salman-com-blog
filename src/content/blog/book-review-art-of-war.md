On the Samuel B. Griffith’s scholarly translation of this chinese warfare classic there are three parts: Introduction , The translation, and Appendix. 

In the introduction he tries to identify the time of when the text was written by comparing many references such as rulers, provinces, agriculture and tools used in the wars. Finally concluding it to be written during ‘The Warring states’ phase of china's military history, that arguably begins at 453 or 403 BC. 

The introduction also attempts to identify the personality of the original author Sun Tzu. Discusses many expert opinions and disputes about whether this classic is an individual effort  Sun Tzu or It's a cumulative knowledge collected by many. As individual writers were very unlikely to exist that time merely because of the pen-paper technology limitations of the ancient time.  

The introduction concludes with the generalisations of Sun Tzu’s thoughts on war and how many later leaders of China including Mao Tse-tung utilized the art of war as a manual for their warfare strategies.

Compared to the barbaric period of Chinese history, thoughts of Sun Tzu were way ahead of it's time that might be still relevant in today's warfare. Rulers that time used to wage wars just of jealousy and the common citizens were treated worts than an ox or a tool. Warfares that time were mostly unorganized and direct confrontation of both sides and resulted in inhumane consequences and unnecessary bloodshed for lacking proper strategy and forward thinking of the generals. The sovereign desperately needed expert strategies to gain advantage over it's enemies. Resulting in many ‘intellectual gamblers’ who used trade pseudo warfare tactics but none persisted long for the failures they induced. Sun Tzu realized that war is a matter of vital importance to the state and it requires proper study and analysis. His systematic approaches and rational thinking about military matters gained traction and later proved to be a worthy manual by his followers like Wu Chi’, Sung Pin etc. 

Sun Tzu didn't conceive war in terms of slaughter and destruction. Instead he prioritized the peaceful strategies to achieve the political objectives. Introduced the necessity of humane planning with sound information and that the usage of weapons is the ultimate and unwanted stage of in an war. 

The manual included many factors and variables of war such as estimating enemies and selfs, offensive and defensive plans, Shape or disposition, Maneuver, Terrain, marches, grounds, usage of fire and employments of agents and spies. Among all the planning and strategies there was a common notion to always perform the indirect and unprecedented actions. 

The appendix of the book contains Wu Chi’s version of the art of war that was called ‘The thirteen chapter’. Wu Chi studied Sun Tzu’s art of war and became a famous general for successfully implementing the it with Marquis Wen, winning 64 out 76 battles opening new lands in every direction for Wei state. Wu chi's thirteen chapter felt comfortable to follow for it's fixed context and characters compared to the original art of war which consisted of generalized advices.

While Sun Tzu points out the todos and not-todos of a good general, ruler and soldier, he passed on advices and practices that to be cultivated to achieve the collective goal of the sovereign states. These insights are still relevant today for anybody involved in leading or managing humans for their business, academic or any collective goal.

> ‘The Art of War’ is a not a fantastic manual on warfare but it's a real and proved winner strategy for more than 2400 years. Because war is not a matter of fantasy, but of strict analysis and control.
